        I am Hispanic First generation college student at the University of Washington in Seattle.
        I am studying computer science because I understood from my experiences and background that
        the only way that developed countries as Colombia, my country, can get out of corruption,
        poverty and violence is with technology. My big future goal in life is to help my community,
        and the best way that I can do that, is creating opportunities and give them resources with
        technology.
      </p>
      <p class="text1">
        Let&apos;s talk about Latin America politics and economics or debate why technology will create
        more jobs than it will remove. Yes, I am technoptimistic, reach me out!
